Note While creating docker compose file 

1. Specify the version
    version: '3'

2. Next will be adding 'services' which we need to use in our project
    Underneath services , we will be adding service name , underneath servicename , we will specify image : image_name (from docker hub which is a base image)
    services:
        postgres:
            image:'postgres:latest'
        redis:
            image:'redis:latest'
3. Next we will be defining our server code base service which has a docker file .Following are the properties 
    services:
        server: //service name
            build: // Here we specify the build properties for this service
                dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev // Name of the docker file 
                context: ./server // Context property specifies which folder we want to access from our current location . Just '.' specifies that we are looking in current directory . './foldername' means we looking for docker file in this directory
            volume: // For Hot Reloading
            environment: // To define environment variables which are used in api
                - REDIST_HOST=redis
                - REDIS_POR=6379
                - PGUSER=postgres
                - PGHOST=postgres
                - PGDATABASE=postgres
                - PGPASSWORD=postgres_password
                - PGPORT=5432
4. Similar process will be followed for worker and client
5. Now there are React UI Routes and API routes which will be accessed from browser. 
   We need to direct these HTTP requests to appropriate  services/servers to react ui server and express api server..
   For this we are going to use and configure an nginx server
   For this we are creating a nginx config file called default.conf -
   In default we mention upstream client and server and give port to identify with the same defined in our docker compose file 
   then we write server code to listen on port 80 and define routing locations for , thereby directing different routes to different server

6. Also this nginx image needs to be build in docker compose by proving a dockerfile and context. We also need to map our desired port to port 80 nginx server
